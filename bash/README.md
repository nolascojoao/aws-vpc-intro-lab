## Conclusion
In Task 6, when attempting to detach and delete the Internet Gateway (IGW) right after deleting the NAT Gateway, I encountered a permission error. This happened because thereâ€™s a slight delay before the NAT Gateway is fully removed. To resolve this, instead of deleting the IGW immediately, I reordered the sequence of commands: after the NAT Gateway was deleted, I inserted the deletion of other resources (such as security groups) before calling the command to remove the IGW. While other approaches, such as loops, sleep commands, or additional checks, could have been applied, this reordering proved to be the simplest and most effective solution.
